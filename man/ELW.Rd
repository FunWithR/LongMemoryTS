\title{Exact local Whittle estimator of the fractional difference parameter d 
for stationary and non-stationary long memory.}
\usage{
ELW(data, m, mean.est = c("mean", "init", "weighted", "none"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data vector of length T.}

\item{m}{bandwith parameter specifying the number of Fourier frequencies.
used for the estimation usually \code{floor(1+T^delta)}, where 0<delta<1.}

\item{mean.est}{specifies the form of mean correction. See details.}
}
\description{
\code{ELW} implements the exact local Whittle estimator of 
Shimotsu and Phillips (2005) that is consistent and asymptotically normal as long as 
the optimization range is less than 9/2, so that it is possible to estimate the memory
of stationary as well as non-stationary processes.
